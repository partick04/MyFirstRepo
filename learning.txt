What I have learned from this course

So far in this course, I have learned how to create and manage a GitHub repository, work with branches, and collaborate using pull requests. I now understand how to fork a repository and contribute to an open-source project by adding changes through a pull request. Additionally, I have learned how important it is to use clear and descriptive commit messages, and how Git helps track and manage the history of my work. These are valuable skills that I will continue to build on as I progress in this course.
